Cancer Cell Detection Using AI


Overview

Early detection of cancer cells is crucial for successful treatment. This project aims to assist in the detection process by automating the analysis of cell images. The application leverages deep learning techniques to accurately identify cancerous cells, which can support medical professionals in making quicker and more reliable diagnoses.


Features

Cancer Cell Detection: Automatically identifies cancer cells in microscopic images.
Pretrained Model: Uses a deep learning model trained on a large dataset of cancer cell images.
Extendable: Designed to be easily extended with new models or additional training data.
